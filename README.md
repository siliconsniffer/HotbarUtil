# HotbarUtil
A hotbar util mod for Minecraft with fabric.

This code has been mostly written by AI.


## Features
- lock hotbar slots with keybind
- keybind for previous and next hotbar slot

## Limitations
While this mod works exactly as indented in singleplayer,
in multiplayer a locked hotbar slot won't prevent the player from dropping it through the inventory.
