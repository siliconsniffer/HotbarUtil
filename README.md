# HotbarUtil
> [!NOTE]
> This code has been mostly written by AI.

This is my first Minecraft mod ever. Set your expectations accordingly.

In contrast to [Luanti](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti), Minecraft has no
keybinds for next and previous hotbar slot.

As a regular Luanti player, I felt the need to do something about this and because
I also tend to accidentally drop items (especially in heated fights), I wanted a
way to prevent items from being dropped.

## Features
- keybind to lock hotbar slots
- keybind for previous and next hotbar slot
